## Edit your code

In the editor, you may code, try, and retry some strategies... Your robot is your weapon.

In San or in js, you may choose between both languages to weaponize your mind and make it to the top.

## Commands ##

You have access to all the languages resources, but a robot is at your service.

He may : 
- walk ( robot.walk([steps]) )
- jump ( robot.jump() )
- check ( robot.check() )
- hit ( robot.hit() )
- turn right ( robot.turn_right() )
- turn left ( robot.turn_left() )
- remember the world he already travelled or checked ( robot.remember() )

## Any introspection ?

Before knowing your enemy, know yourself. 

Come on the `me`, and check yourself. Change your default language to defend yourself on your free time. Change your password. Check your points, and your KDA (Kool, Dis Addition !).

## You got more power (than you deserve ?)

Feel free to explore the dashboard, a dashing form cutting through the sky.

Here, you may add power to groups...
